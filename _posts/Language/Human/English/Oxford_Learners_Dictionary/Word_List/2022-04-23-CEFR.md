CEFR stands for the <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>‘Common European Framework of Reference’</span> for languages, which is a description of the language abilities of students at different levels of learning. The CEFR can be used to compare standards in language learning and create teaching programmes.

It grades language skills at six levels:

<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>A1 and A2</span> indicate elementary and pre-intermediate levels of ability.  
<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>B1 and B2</span> indicate lower- and upper-intermediate levels.  
<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>C1</span> indicates advanced level.  
<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>C2</span> indicates complete proficiency in the language.  

The CEFR grades language skills – what students can do in the language, for example ‘can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics’ (at B2). It does not grade specific grammar points or vocabulary items. However, we have aligned our core vocabulary lists, the Oxford 3000 and Oxford 5000, and the Oxford Phrase List, to the levels of the CEFR in order to guide learners of English on the most important words and phrases to learn at each level.

<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>The Oxford 3000</span> includes words from A1 to B2 level.  
<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>The Oxford 5000</span> contains an additional 2000 words at B2 to C1 level.  
<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>The Oxford Phrase List</span> includes phrases from A1 to C1 level.
